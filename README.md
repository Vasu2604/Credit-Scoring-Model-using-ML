# Credit-Scoring-Model-using-ML
This project demonstrates the development of a credit scoring model using machine learning techniques. The model is designed to evaluate the creditworthiness of individuals based on various financial and demographic factors.


Project Overview:

Credit scoring is a crucial process in the financial industry, used by lenders to assess the risk associated with lending money to individuals. This project implements a machine learning approach to create a robust and accurate credit scoring model.


The main steps in this project include:

1.Data preprocessing
2.Exploratory data analysis
3.Feature engineering and selection
4.Model building and evaluation
5.Implementation of new data

Technologies Used:

1.Python
2.Pandas
3.NumPy
4.Matplotlib
5.Seaborn
6.Scikit-learn
7.Imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE)
8. Machine learning models 


Key Features:
* Handling of missing values and outliers
* Feature encoding and scaling
* Multicollinearity check using VIF
* Class imbalance handling with SMOTE
* Model selection using cross-validation
* Random Forest Classifier as the final model

Results
The model achieves 84% accuracy on the RandomForest model on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting credit scores.

Future Improvements:

* Experiment with other machine learning algorithms
* Fine-tune hyperparameters using grid search or random search
* Incorporate more features or external data sources
